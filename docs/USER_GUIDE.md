- 🔵 **Investment**: Money you invest (stocks, savings, etc.)

### Categories

Categories help organize your transactions. They can be:

- **Hierarchical**: Create parent and child categories
  - Example: Food → Groceries, Restaurants
- **Type-Specific**: Each category belongs to Income, Expense, or Investment
- **Customizable**: Choose icon and color for each category

**Example Category Structure**:
```
Expenses
├── Food
│   ├── Groceries
│   └── Restaurants
├── Transportation
│   ├── Gas
│   └── Public Transit
└── Housing
    ├── Rent
    └── Utilities
```

### Contexts

Contexts are optional tags for transactions:
- **Work**: Business-related expenses
- **Personal**: Personal spending
- **Family**: Family expenses
- **Vacation**: Travel-related

Use contexts to track spending across different areas of your life.

- **Start Date**: When to begin
- **End Date**: When to stop (optional)
- **Auto-Generate**: Automatically creates transactions
